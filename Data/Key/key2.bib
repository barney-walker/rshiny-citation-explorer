Abstract = {{The balance equations for the entropy in the atmosphere are presented
   and discussed. Using observed energy fluxes and atmospheric
   temperatures, we present estimates of the various terms in the global
   mean entropy budget. The largest boundary fluxes of entropy are
   associated with the emission of longwave radiation. The fluxes of
   entropy associated with turbulent and molecular diffusion are found to
   be much smaller. On the planetary scale the mean outgoing flux of
   entropy at the top of the atmosphere is found to be about 22 times
   larger than the mean incoming flux of entropy through solar radiation.
   The rates of entropy production and destruction by the various
   irreversible processes that occur in the atmosphere are also computed.
   The entropy production terms involved in the release of latent heat and
   the absorption of solar radiation are, by far, the largest sources of
   entropy for the atmosphere, whereas the production of entropy associated
   with the absorption of longwave radiation is an order of magnitude
   smaller. The destruction is mainly accomplished through cooling by
   outgoing longwave radiation. The contributions of the sensible heat
   fluxes and friction are relatively small. Regional contributions to the
   total entropy generation in the atmosphere are studied by considering an
   equatorial region bounded by two latitudinal walls at 15-degrees-N and
   15-degrees-S and a polar region poleward of 70-degrees-N. The rates of
   entropy generation by the various diabetic processes are highest in the
   equatorial region; part of the generated entropy is exported to higher
   latitudes.}},
